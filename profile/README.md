# Welcome to Lab Digital

Here you find our library of open-source SDKs and libraries developed over years and used in production for many sites.

Open-source is close to our hearts. We love creating reusable software and sharing these with the community. We believe that having a large open-source footprint, allows us to build higher quality solutions, faster and with more consistency.

Our open-source projects focus mainly on the following:

- Terraform providers for MACH platforms
- Platform SDKs and libraries
- Cloudnative tools and libraries for Python / Django


[![Lab Digital is hiring cloud native software engineers that love open source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/labd/.github/main/profile/github-hiring-banner.jpg)](https://careers.labdigital.nl?lang=en)
